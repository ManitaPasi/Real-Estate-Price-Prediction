# Real Estate Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict real estate prices based on various property features. The model aims to aid both buyers and sellers in the real estate market by providing an accurate estimation of property prices, enabling informed decision-making.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains real estate listings data, including features like:
- Location
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Square Footage
- Year Built
- Amenities, etc.

The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables to make it suitable for building predictive models.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
    - scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the regression model.
    - TensorFlow/PyTorch: Explored to enhance predictive accuracy.
    - pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
    - Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Analysis

We perform an extensive exploratory data analysis to understand the trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. Visualizations are created to gain insights into the factors that influence real estate prices the most.

## Model Development

A variety of regression models are tested, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value.

## Feature Selection

Important features contributing to the prediction are identified. A correlation matrix and feature importance techniques are employed to select the features that significantly impact the real estate prices.

## Results

The model demonstrates satisfactory performance in predicting real estate prices. The findings, including the important features and model evaluation results, are thoroughly documented.

## Future Work

- Enhance the model by tuning hyperparameters and experimenting with more advanced algorithms.
- Expand the dataset to include more features like proximity to essential services, public transport, and crime rates to improve prediction accuracy.
- Develop a web application to make the model accessible to users for real-time price predictions.
